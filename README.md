## Usage

This day planner provides you with the current date and time on the top of the page and below allows you to plan the workday from 9-5. time that has not passed yet on the planner is marked green, and the current time on the planner is marked yellow, also time that has already padded is marked gray. you may add in events on the page by clinking into the colored area and writing in your plans, then pressing the save button to save your event. this will save the information even if you colse out the window. since this is a daily planner is it set to automatically reset the calendar every day at midnight

![A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.](./Assets/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)
